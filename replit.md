# EmotionalChain - Proof of Emotion Blockchain

## Overview

EmotionalChain is a revolutionary blockchain platform that implements Proof of Emotion (PoE) consensus, using real-time biometric data from validators to secure the network. The system combines traditional blockchain technology with emotional authenticity verification through heart rate monitors, stress detectors, and focus measurement devices. This creates a unique consensus mechanism where validators must maintain optimal emotional states to participate in block validation and earn rewards.

The platform features a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, Express.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and comprehensive P2P networking capabilities. The system integrates advanced features like quantum-resistant cryptography, cross-chain bridges, AI-powered anomaly detection, and privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proofs.
