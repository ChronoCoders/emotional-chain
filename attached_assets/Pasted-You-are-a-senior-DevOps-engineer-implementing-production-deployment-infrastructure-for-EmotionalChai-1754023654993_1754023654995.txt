You are a senior DevOps engineer implementing production deployment infrastructure for EmotionalChain, a distributed blockchain with Proof of Emotion consensus. This is NOT a demo, simulation, or mock implementation - this is REAL production infrastructure deployment.

CRITICAL: Use only REAL production values, live data, actual metrics, and genuine operational configurations. No hardcoded demo values, no mock data, no simulation placeholders.

## PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. DATABASE INDEX IMPLEMENTATION (30 minutes)
- Analyze existing PostgreSQL database schema in shared/schema.ts
- Identify high-traffic query patterns from consensus operations
- Create PRODUCTION-GRADE indexes for:
 * Consensus round lookups (blocks table with height, validator_id, emotional_score)
 * Active validator queries (validator_states with is_active, emotional_score filters)
 * Biometric data validation (biometric_data with validator_id, timestamp ranges)
 * Transaction processing (transactions with block_hash, status, created_at)
- Use CONCURRENT index creation to avoid blocking live operations
- Include covering indexes for frequently accessed columns
- Implement partial indexes for filtered queries (active validators only, recent timestamps)

### 2. KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT MANIFESTS (2 hours)
- Create PRODUCTION Kubernetes manifests for multi-region deployment:
 * StatefulSet for validator nodes (persistent storage, ordered deployment)
 * Service definitions for P2P networking (TCP 8000, WebSocket 8001)
 * ConfigMaps for environment-specific configuration
 * Secrets for database credentials and encryption keys
 * PersistentVolumeClaims for blockchain data storage
 * NetworkPolicies for security isolation
- Configure REAL resource limits based on actual performance benchmarks
- Implement health checks using existing /health endpoints
- Set up horizontal pod autoscaling based on consensus load
- Configure anti-affinity rules for geographic distribution

### 3. MULTI-REGION BOOTSTRAP CONFIGURATION (1 hour)
- Implement automatic bootstrap peer discovery across AWS regions:
 * us-west-2 (North America primary)
 * eu-west-1 (Europe primary) 
 * ap-southeast-1 (Asia Pacific primary)
- Configure libp2p bootstrap nodes with REAL IP addresses and peer IDs
- Implement DNS-based service discovery for dynamic peer resolution
- Set up cross-region connectivity with proper firewall rules
- Configure WebRTC STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal
- Implement regional failover and automatic peer rotation

### 4. GRAFANA DASHBOARD SETUP (1 hour)
- Create comprehensive Grafana dashboards using REAL Prometheus metrics from server/monitoring/system-metrics.ts:
 * Consensus performance: success rates, round duration, validator participation
 * Network health: connected peers, message throughput, regional distribution
 * Biometric validation: device readings per second, authenticity scores, error rates
 * Security monitoring: Byzantine detection alerts, rate limiting violations
 * System performance: CPU, memory, database connections, disk I/O
- Configure REAL alerting rules for production incidents
- Set up notification channels (Slack, PagerDuty, email)
- Implement SLA monitoring dashboards for uptime tracking

### 5. CI/CD PIPELINE IMPLEMENTATION (3 hours)
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment:
 * Multi-stage build process (test, security scan, build, deploy)
 * Automated testing pipeline running the comprehensive test suite
 * Security scanning with Snyk/Trivy for vulnerabilities
 * Multi-region deployment with blue-green strategy
 * Database migration automation with rollback capability
 * Automated performance testing against production load
- Implement GitOps deployment with ArgoCD or Flux
- Set up staging environment for pre-production validation
- Configure automated rollback triggers based on health metrics

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Database Requirements:
- Use existing Neon PostgreSQL connection from server/db.ts
- Query real blockchain data from blocks, transactions, validator_states tables
- Implement connection pooling for high-throughput operations
- Use prepared statements for performance optimization

### Networking Requirements:
- Integrate with existing libp2p P2P networking from network/P2PNode.ts
- Support WebRTC, TCP, and WebSocket transports
- Configure DHT-based peer discovery with Kademlia routing
- Implement pubsub messaging for consensus coordination

### Monitoring Integration:
- Use existing PrometheusMetrics from server/monitoring/system-metrics.ts
- Collect REAL metrics from consensus operations, not synthetic values
- Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Configure log aggregation with structured JSON logging

### Security Requirements:
- Implement TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- Use HashiCorp Vault for secrets management in production
- Configure RBAC for Kubernetes cluster access
- Implement network segmentation with proper firewall rules

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Each component must be:
✅ Production-ready with real operational data
✅ Scalable to 1000+ validators across multiple regions  
✅ Fault-tolerant with automatic failover and recovery
✅ Monitored with comprehensive observability
✅ Secure with enterprise-grade authentication and encryption
✅ Automated with zero-downtime deployment capability

## DELIVERABLES

1. SQL scripts for production database indexes
2. Complete Kubernetes manifests for multi-region deployment
3. Bootstrap configuration files with real peer discovery
4. Grafana dashboard JSON exports with real metric queries
5. GitHub Actions workflow files for automated CI/CD
6. Documentation for production deployment procedures
7. Monitoring and alerting configuration files
8. Security hardening checklist and implementation

Implement these as PRODUCTION-GRADE infrastructure suitable for processing real blockchain transactions, handling actual validator consensus, and supporting genuine economic activity. No shortcuts, no demo data, no mock implementations.

Execute with the precision and reliability required for financial infrastructure handling millions of dollars in transaction volume.
