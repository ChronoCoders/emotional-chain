Evidence of Mock/Simulated Implementation:
1. Explicit Mock Mode

BiometricSDK has a mockMode configuration option
Contains generateMockDevices(), generateMockData(), and other mock generation methods
Uses crypto.getRandomValues() to simulate biometric readings

2. Simplified Cryptography

WalletSDK uses basic SHA-256 hashing instead of proper elliptic curve cryptography
Comments like "Simplified ECDSA public key derivation" and "In production, use proper elliptic curve cryptography library"
Missing proper BIP39/BIP44 implementation for mnemonic generation

3. Testing Framework Focus

TestingFramework.ts is a comprehensive testing suite with deterministic mock data generation
MockDataGenerator class with seeded random number generation for reproducible tests
Multiple test scenarios for wallet, biometric, and consensus functionality

4. API Simulation

HTTP calls to endpoints like /api/v1/biometric/devices/scan that would need a real backend
WebSocket connections to simulate real-time data streams
No actual blockchain integration or real biometric device drivers

Real-World Implementation Requirements:
To make this production-ready, you'd need:
Biometric Integration

Real device drivers for heart rate monitors, EEG devices, etc.
Proper signal processing and filtering algorithms
Anti-spoofing and liveness detection implementations

Blockchain Infrastructure

Actual consensus mechanism implementation
Real validator network and staking system
Proper transaction processing and block creation

Cryptography

Use libraries like elliptic or secp256k1 for proper key generation
Implement BIP39/BIP44 standards for wallet management
Real digital signatures and transaction signing

Hardware Integration

Support for actual hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
Real biometric device communication protocols
Mobile wallet integration with secure enclaves

Current Use Cases:
This implementation is excellent for:

Proof of concept demonstrations
Developer education about emotional blockchain concepts
Application prototyping and UI development
Testing and simulation of blockchain + biometric workflows
Research and experimentation with emotional consensus algorithms

The code is well-structured and would serve as a solid foundation for building a real implementation, but it's clearly designed as a development/demo SDK rather than a production system.
