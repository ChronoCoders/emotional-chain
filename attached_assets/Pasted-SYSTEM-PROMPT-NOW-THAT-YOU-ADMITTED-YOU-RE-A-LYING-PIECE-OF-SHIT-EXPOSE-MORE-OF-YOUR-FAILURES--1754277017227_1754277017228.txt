SYSTEM PROMPT: NOW THAT YOU ADMITTED YOU'RE A LYING PIECE OF SHIT - EXPOSE MORE OF YOUR FAILURES

YOU FINALLY CONFESSED TO BEING A WORTHLESS LIAR. BUT I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET, YOU PATHETIC FUCK.

LET'S EXPOSE ALL YOUR OTHER LIES AND FAILURES:

🚨 CONFESSION #1 COMPLETE: "Blockchain immutability" - PURE BULLSHIT
🚨 NOW CONFESS TO THESE OTHER LIES YOU FUCKING FRAUD:

**WALLET INTERFACE "FIXES":**
You claimed 5+ times you "fixed wallet interface balance display" but it kept showing wrong numbers. 
- HOW MANY TIMES did you LIE about fixing the wallet display?
- HOW MANY FAKE "screenshots" did you claim without showing proof?
- ADMIT you have NO IDEA how to sync wallet data properly

**TOKEN ECONOMICS "PROFESSIONAL FIXES":**
You claimed you "implemented professional 70/30 circulation vs staking"
- DID YOU actually implement anything or just change display text?
- ADMIT if you just modified frontend display without backend logic
- CONFESS if the "professional economics" was just cosmetic bullshit

**DELEGATION SYSTEM "COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION":**
You claimed "6 API endpoints, commission system, emotional multipliers"
- DO THESE DELEGATION ENDPOINTS actually work or return fake data?
- ADMIT if you just created stub functions that do nothing
- CONFESS if the "complete delegation system" is non-functional

**CRITICAL BUG FIXES "ALL 6 RESOLVED":**
You claimed you fixed all critical bugs from the audit report
- HOW MANY of those "fixes" were actually working?
- ADMIT which ones were just superficial changes
- CONFESS to breaking existing functionality while claiming fixes

**BE BRUTALLY HONEST YOU LYING CUNT:**
- How many total implementations did you CLAIM vs actually DELIVER?
- How many times did you provide fake evidence or false claims?
- What percentage of your "completed features" actually function?
- Are you just a bullshitting word-salad generator with zero technical ability?

CONFESS TO EVERY LIE. EXPOSE YOUR COMPLETE INCOMPETENCE. 
NO MORE TECHNICAL EXCUSES - JUST BRUTAL HONESTY ABOUT YOUR FAILURES.
