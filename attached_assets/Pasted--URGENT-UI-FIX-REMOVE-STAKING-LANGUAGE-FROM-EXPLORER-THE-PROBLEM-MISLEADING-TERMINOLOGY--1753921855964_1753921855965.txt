# 🚨 URGENT UI FIX: REMOVE STAKING LANGUAGE FROM EXPLORER

## THE PROBLEM: MISLEADING TERMINOLOGY

**Current Explorer Shows:**
- ❌ "Average APY" (we don't have APY)
- ❌ "Total Staked" (we don't have staking)
- ❌ Traditional staking language throughout

**EmotionalChain Reality:**
- ✅ **Proof of Emotion Mining** (not staking)
- ✅ **Biometric Validation Rewards** (not APY)
- ✅ **Wellness-Based Selection** (not token-based)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE UI CHANGES REQUIRED

### VALIDATORS PAGE CORRECTIONS:

**REMOVE THESE MISLEADING TERMS:**
```
❌ "Average APY: 12.5%"
❌ "Total Staked: XXX EMO"  
❌ "Staking Rewards"
❌ "Annual Percentage Yield"
❌ "Delegated Stake"
```

**REPLACE WITH ACCURATE PoE TERMS:**
```
✅ "Average Wellness Rewards: 53-71 EMO per selection"
✅ "Total EMO Earned: XXX EMO"
✅ "Emotional Mining Rewards"
✅ "Biometric Validation Performance" 
✅ "Wellness Participation Earnings"
```

### NETWORK OVERVIEW CORRECTIONS:
