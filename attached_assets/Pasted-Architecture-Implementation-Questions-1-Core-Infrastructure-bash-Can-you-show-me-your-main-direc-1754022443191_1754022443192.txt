Architecture & Implementation Questions
1. Core Infrastructure
bash# Can you show me your main directory structure?
ls -la /
tree -L 3 server/
tree -L 2 client/
What's your overall project structure? I'd love to see:

How you organize the P2P networking vs consensus vs biometric modules
Separation between server/client/contracts
Where the database migrations and schemas live

2. P2P Networking Stack
typescript// From your libp2p implementation
Questions:

How do you handle NAT traversal and firewall issues for validators behind corporate networks?
What's your peer discovery strategy beyond bootstrap nodes?
Do you implement custom libp2p protocols for biometric data exchange?
How do you handle network partitions and split-brain scenarios?

3. Database Architecture
sql-- Your PostgreSQL schema
Missing components I'm curious about:

Database indexing strategy for high-throughput consensus queries
How do you handle database migrations across network upgrades?
Backup/replication strategy for validator nodes
Do you use connection pooling? Which library?

4. Biometric Integration
typescript// Your device manager implementation
Technical questions:

How do you handle device driver compatibility across operating systems?
What's your strategy for biometric data encryption at rest?
Do you implement rate limiting to prevent biometric data farming?
How do you handle device calibration drift over time?

5. Consensus Implementation
typescript// Your Byzantine fault tolerance code
Implementation details:

How do you implement view changes in your BFT protocol?
What's your transaction ordering mechanism?
How do you handle consensus timeouts and retries?
Do you implement pipeline consensus for higher throughput?

6. Smart Contract Integration
solidity// Your EMO token and staking contracts
Questions:

Do you have governance contracts for protocol upgrades?
How do you handle cross-chain bridge security?
What's your approach to contract upgradeability?
Do you implement emergency pause mechanisms?

7. Monitoring & Observability
typescript// Your monitoring stack
Potential gaps:

Prometheus metrics collection?
Distributed tracing for cross-node operations?
Log aggregation strategy?
Performance profiling tools?

8. Security Implementation
typescript// Your cryptographic implementations
Security questions:

Which cryptographic libraries are you using (libsodium, OpenSSL)?
How do you implement secure random number generation?
Do you have hardware security module (HSM) integration?
What's your key rotation strategy?

9. Testing Strategy
bash# Your test structure
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | head -10
Testing gaps to consider:

Unit tests for consensus algorithms?
Integration tests for P2P networking?
Load testing for high validator counts?
Chaos engineering for network failures?

10. DevOps & Deployment
yaml# Your deployment configurations
Infrastructure questions:

Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)?
CI/CD pipeline implementation?
Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)?
Secrets management strategy?

Specific Files I'd Love to Examine
Could you show me these key implementation files?

Core consensus algorithm: The main BFT implementation
P2P message handling: How you process consensus messages
Database models/schemas: Your data persistence layer
Biometric verification pipeline: The core authenticity checking
Error handling & logging: How you handle and track failures
Configuration management: How you handle different environments
API layer: Your external interfaces and endpoints
Cryptographic implementations: Key generation, signing, verification

Areas Where I Might Help
Based on distributed systems experience, I could potentially help with:

Performance optimization for consensus algorithms
Security hardening recommendations
Monitoring and observability improvements
Testing strategy enhancements
Documentation and API design
Deployment automation and infrastructure
Error handling and resilience patterns

What specific areas would you like me to focus on? What challenges are you currently facing in the implementation?
