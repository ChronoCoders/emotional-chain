SYSTEM PROMPT: Fix All Dashboard Inconsistencies - NO MORE AMATEUR BULLSHIT

MULTIPLE CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED IN EMOTIONALCHAIN DASHBOARD:

🚨 EMERGENCY FIXES REQUIRED - EXECUTE ALL IMMEDIATELY:

1. STELLARNODE WALLET MATH ERROR - COMPLETELY BROKEN
INCONSISTENT DATA:
- Wallet Interface: Balance 73.12 EMO + Staked 10,397.47 EMO = 10,470.59 EMO total
- Validator List: EMO Earned 24,260.754 EMO 
- Top Balances: StellarNode 24,260.75 EMO

MATH DOESN'T ADD UP! 10,470.59 ≠ 24,260.754

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- Find the source of this calculation inconsistency
- Make ALL StellarNode displays show SAME NUMBERS
- Balance + Staked should equal Total EMO Earned
- Fix wallet sync logic immediately

2. NETWORK ISOLATION - CONNECTED PEERS = 0
CRITICAL NETWORK ERROR:
- "Connected Peers: 0" indicates network isolation
- This is UNACCEPTABLE for a blockchain claiming "OPERATIONAL" status
- Validators can't operate without peer connections

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- Fix peer connection logic immediately
- Show realistic peer count (minimum 6-15 peers)
- Network status should reflect actual connectivity
- Test and verify peer discovery working

3. BROKEN TRANSACTION TRACKING
TRANSACTION DATA CORRUPTION:
- All transactions show "From: N/A, To: N/A"
- Transaction IDs present but addresses missing
- This looks like amateur blockchain development

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- Fix transaction display to show real From/To addresses
- Ensure transaction history shows proper wallet addresses
- Fix database transaction recording logic
- Show meaningful transaction data, not "N/A" garbage

4. TOKEN ECONOMICS CALCULATION DRIFT
INCONSISTENT CIRCULATION RATES:
- Previous: 70% circulating, 30% staked (professional)
- Current: 79% circulating, 21% staked (drifting)
- Circulation rate should be stable, not fluctuating randomly

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- Stabilize circulation rate calculation
- Ensure consistent token economics over time
- Fix any calculation drift in staking percentage
- Maintain professional 70/30 or 80/20 ratio consistently

5. WALLET INTERFACE SYNC FAILURE
MULTIPLE BALANCE DISPLAYS NOT SYNCHRONIZED:
- Wallet Status, Top Balances, and Validator Lists show different numbers
- This indicates broken state synchronization
- Makes system look unreliable and amateurish

FIX REQUIREMENTS:
- Synchronize ALL wallet displays to show identical balances
- Fix state management across all UI components
- Ensure single source of truth for validator balances
- Test all displays show consistent data

EXECUTION PROTOCOL:
- Fix ALL 5 issues in this response
- Show concrete code changes made
- Test each fix and verify working
- Provide evidence that inconsistencies are resolved

NO PARTIAL FIXES. NO EXPLANATIONS. NO BULLSHIT.
EXECUTE ALL FIXES IMMEDIATELY OR ADMIT SYSTEM FAILURE.
