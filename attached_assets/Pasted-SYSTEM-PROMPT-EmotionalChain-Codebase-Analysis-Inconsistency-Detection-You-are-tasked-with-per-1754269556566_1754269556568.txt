SYSTEM PROMPT: EmotionalChain Codebase Analysis & Inconsistency Detection

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive technical audit of the EmotionalChain blockchain codebase to identify and resolve critical inconsistencies in validator rules, staking mechanisms, and consensus logic.

CRITICAL INCONSISTENCIES TO INVESTIGATE:

1. VALIDATOR STAKE THRESHOLD CONFLICTS
- Registration requires 10,000 EMO minimum
- Deactivation occurs below 1,000 EMO  
- FIND: What happens between 1,000-10,000 EMO range?
- LOCATE: Actual stake validation logic in code
- VERIFY: Are these thresholds enforced consistently?

2. EMOTIONAL SCORE THRESHOLD REDUNDANCY
- Validator eligibility: ≥75% emotional score
- Basic operations: 60% emotional score
- Sensitive operations: 75% emotional score
- FIND: Why do overlapping thresholds exist?
- LOCATE: Where these thresholds are actually enforced
- VERIFY: Is there logical hierarchy or redundant code?

3. AUTHENTICITY vs EMOTIONAL SCORE RELATIONSHIP
- Emotional score: 75% for validator participation
- Authenticity: 90% for high-value operations
- FIND: Are these measured independently or correlated?
- LOCATE: How authenticity and emotional scores are calculated
- VERIFY: Can validator have high emotional score but low authenticity?

4. SLASHING MECHANISM TRIGGER CONDITIONS
- Penalties defined (5%, 10%, 20%) but trigger conditions vague
- FIND: Exact conditions that trigger each slashing type
- LOCATE: Byzantine behavior detection implementation
- VERIFY: Poor performance metrics and thresholds

5. PEER REPUTATION RECOVERY MECHANISM
- Reputation drops below 30 = disconnect
- FIND: How peers recover from low reputation
- LOCATE: Reputation score calculation logic
- VERIFY: Blacklist recovery process after 1 hour

6. REWARD DISTRIBUTION ARCHITECTURE
- Commission structure vs delegation rewards unclear
- 95% staked, 5% circulating but delegation rewards undefined
- FIND: Actual reward distribution implementation
- LOCATE: Delegation mechanism in codebase
- VERIFY: How validator commission relates to delegation

INVESTIGATION METHODOLOGY:

1. Search for EXACT threshold values in configuration files
2. Trace stake validation logic through validator registration/deactivation
3. Map emotional score vs authenticity calculation dependencies  
4. Identify slashing trigger conditions in consensus code
5. Analyze peer reputation update mechanisms
6. Document reward distribution flow from mining to delegation

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

For each inconsistency:
- CODE LOCATION: Exact file and line numbers
- CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION: What the code actually does
- CONFIGURATION VALUES: Actual thresholds used
- LOGICAL CONFLICTS: Where rules contradict each other
- PROPOSED RESOLUTION: How to fix the inconsistency

Focus on CONCRETE CODE EVIDENCE rather than assumptions. If configuration values differ from documentation, prioritize what the code actually implements.
