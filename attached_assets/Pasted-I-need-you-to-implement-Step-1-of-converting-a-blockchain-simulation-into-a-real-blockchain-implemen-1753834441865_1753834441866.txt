I need you to implement Step 1 of converting a blockchain simulation into a real blockchain implementation. This is for an innovative "Proof of Emotion" consensus mechanism.

TASK: Create the cryptographic foundation with these specific requirements:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install elliptic @types/elliptic

Create file: crypto/KeyPair.ts


Implement elliptic curve cryptography using secp256k1
Generate wallet addresses from public keys
Sign and verify messages/transactions
Export KeyPair class


Create file: crypto/Transaction.ts


Real transaction class with digital signatures
Calculate transaction hashes
Validate transaction signatures
Support for biometric data in transaction metadata
Export Transaction class


Create file: crypto/MerkleTree.ts


Build merkle trees from transaction arrays
Generate merkle proofs for verification
Verify merkle proofs against root hash
Export MerkleTree class


Create file: crypto/Block.ts


Real block structure with merkle roots
Calculate cryptographic block hashes
IMPORTANT: Replace mining with "Proof of Emotion" validation
Light computational work (difficulty 2) since validators are pre-selected by emotional score
Validate blocks using emotional consensus data
Export Block class


Create file: crypto/EmotionalValidator.ts


Interface for validators with biometric data
Emotional score calculation from biometric inputs
Authenticity verification
Export EmotionalValidator interface


Key Requirements:


Use secp256k1 elliptic curve (same as Bitcoin/Ethereum)
Generate addresses with format: 0x[40-char-hex]
Transaction signatures must be verifiable
Blocks use merkle trees for transaction integrity
Keep Proof of Emotion consensus - don't use traditional Proof of Work
Emotional validators need: heartRate, stressLevel, focusLevel, authenticity
Light block validation since emotional consensus pre-selects validators


Test file: crypto/test.ts


Create test wallets (Alice, Bob)
Create signed transactions
Build blocks with Proof of Emotion validation
Verify all cryptographic components work
Show emotional validator selection process

CRITICAL: This keeps the innovative "Proof of Emotion" consensus but adds real cryptographic security. Don't change the emotional consensus mechanism - just make the crypto real.
Output should be production-ready TypeScript with proper error handling and console logging to show the emotional consensus in action.
